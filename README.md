First, we add a private static Logger attribute change the constructor from public to private so that the getLog method can accsess it add a public static method that will check if there is no Logger object using if statement then create a Logger object if there was no instance was made else will return the object. Now in other classes if we want to make a Logger file (instance) we use Logger.getLog()  to create one instance.
